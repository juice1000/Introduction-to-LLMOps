It states liability insurance protects against 'non-collision events' which is a good starting point, but it doesn\u2019t elaborate on the *specific* types of damage it covers. It also doesn't mention the potential for lawsuits or financial responsibility. A more detailed explanation of potential liabilities would strengthen the response.\n\n",
