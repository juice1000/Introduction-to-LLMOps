However, it lacks detail and doesn't differentiate between different types of coverage (e.g., specific medical conditions). It also doesn\u2019t explain *how* these policies work or what potential benefits they offer.\n\nEssentially, it's a good starting point but needs more depth to be truly helpful.",
